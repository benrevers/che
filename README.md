#Che.py - The business search tool

I originally wrote this in response to a call from the Planet Sub owners for a guerllia marketing campaign against all local business. All GM's were to call local businesses and pitch our catering services, hoping to score more large catering contracts. The only problem was nobody had a good solution for who to call and how to approach the sale except for "opening up a phonebook and choosing at random".

This tool solved that problem by giving GM's a list of businesses in a defined radius (usually just outside of near stores radius as to not double-call) and allowded them to be more effective in there marketing, leading to more sales.
 
Support for searching by type was never introduced as I left Planet Sub shortly after, but was meant to allow GM's to target specific high-paying markets including doctors offices, dentists offices, universities and real eastate agencys all of which, in 2016, had money to spend in the intrest of wooing prospective customers.
